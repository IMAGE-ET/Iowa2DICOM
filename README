NOTE: these scripts were used for conversion of the Iowa QIN-HEADNECK derived data. 
They are not maintained, and instead the general purpose functionality is being 
migrated into the Reporting repository https://github.com/fedorov/Reporting
and into the 3D Slicer core.

The process of data conversion is described in the following manuscript:

Fedorov A, Clunie D, Ulrich E, Bauer C, Wahle A, Brown B, Onken M, Riesmeier J, 
Pieper S, Kikinis R, Buatti J, Beichel RR. (2015) DICOM for quantitative imaging 
biomarker development: A standards based approach to sharing of clinical data and 
structured PET/CT analysis results in head and neck cancer research. 
PeerJ PrePrints 3:e1921 https://dx.doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.1541v1

The resulting data is available in TCIA QIN-HEADNECK collection:
