NOTE: these scripts were used for conversion of the Iowa QIN-HEADNECK derived data. 
They are not maintained, and instead the general purpose functionality is being 
migrated into the Reporting repository https://github.com/fedorov/Reporting
and into the 3D Slicer core.


Repository of scripts and converters to store the segmentations, SUV and 
measurements produced by QIICR Iowa use case for a single timpoint of treatment
into DICOM format.

The initial assumptions are the following:
 1) the data is arranged in a predefined directory structure;
 2) the set of structures and codes is predefined and fixed;
 3) ...

The scripts leverage related tools that calculate SUVbw factor and 
quantitative indices over the ROI.
